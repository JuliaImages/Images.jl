An open-source image processing library for [Julia](http://julialang.org/).

## Project organization

Images.jl is increasingly becoming an "umbrella package" that bundles and re-exports other packages.
Most of these packages are hosted at
[JuliaImages](https://github.com/JuliaImages),
[JuliaArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays),
[JuliaGraphics](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics), and
[JuliaMath](https://github.com/JuliaMath).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get started contributing to JuliaImages.

We are a welcoming and supportive community made up of volunteer developers.
All participants are expected to abide by the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/).

## Credits

Elements of this package descend from "image.jl"
that once lived in Julia's `extras/` directory.
That file had several authors, of which the primary were
Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Kroboth, Tim Holy, Mike Nolta, and Stefan Karpinski.
This repository has been quite heavily reworked;
please see the "contributors" tab above and on many of the other repositories at [JuliaImages](https://github.com/JuliaImages) and elsewhere.
