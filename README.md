## Credits

Elements of this package descend from "image.jl"
that once lived in Julia's `extras/` directory.
That file had several authors, of which the primary were
Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Kroboth, Tim Holy, Mike Nolta, and Stefan Karpinski.
This repository has been quite heavily reworked;
please see the "contributors" tab above and on many of the other repositories at [JuliaImages](https://github.com/JuliaImages) and elsewhere.
