# Getting started

For these examples you'll need to install both `Images` and `ImageView`.
Load the code for these packages with

```julia
using Images
using ImageView
```

## Image I/O

You likely have a number of images already at your disposal,
but if not you can retrieve a collection by running `readremote.jl` in the `test/` directory.
(This requires an internet connection.)
These will be deposited inside an `Images` directory inside your temporary directory
(e.g., `/tmp` on Linux systems).

Read an image from a file:
```
julia> img = imread("rose.png")
RGB Image with:
  data: 3x70x46 Uint8 Array
  properties:
    colordim: 1
    spatialorder: ["x", "y"]
    colorspace: RGB
```
Note that the image was loaded in "non-permuted" form, i.e., following the direct representation on disk.
If you prefer to work with plain arrays, you can convert it:
```
julia> imA = convert(Array, img);

julia> summary(imA)
"46x70x3 Uint8 Array"
```
You can see that this permuted the dimensions into the array-canonical order.

Writing works similarly:
```
julia> imwrite(img, "rose2.jpg")
```
or, if you've been using an array:
```
julia> imwrite(convert(Image, imA), "rose2.jpg")
```
The image file type is inferred from the extension.

## Image display

The most direct approach is the `display` command:
```
julia> display(img)
```
For further information see the [ImageView](https://github.com/timholy/ImageView.jl) documentation.

## Working with images: some examples

Here's a short example that may help you get started:
```
using Images
using ImageView
using Color
img = float64(imread("peppers.png"))  # an RGB image (you can pick anything)
h = ones(7,7)/49;                     # a boxcar smoothing filter
imgf = imfilter(img, h)
display(img)
display(imgf)
clp = ClipMinMax(Uint8, 0.0, 255.0)
imgc = scale(clp,3img)                # generate an oversaturated image
display(imgc)
imgp = permutedims(img,[2,3,1])       # so we don't have to call squeeze() next
O = Overlay((imgp["color",2],imgp["color",1]),(RGB(0,0,1),RGB(1,1,0)),((0,255),(0,255)))
display(O,xy=["y","x"])
```
